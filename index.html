<h1>Work set-up</h1>
To begin with my working space is based on compartments. Initially this was not the case, however, as I gradually worked on the thesis, the number of files grew and scrolling through the document became a headache if I didn't put my files into their own compartments. Reading <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2013/08/02/thesis-series-pt1.html" title="Compartments tutorial" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> on how to go about large documents with <code>LaTeX</code> helped me a lot.
<h3>Main folder</h3>
The main folder contains 9 sub-folders, and 9 files includring the root file, <code>THESIS.tex</code>.
<h3>The 9 sub-folders</h3>
<ol class="custom-counter">
  <li><code>BackFrontMat/</code> &ndash; This folder contains the files for the back and front matter&mdash;one <code>.tex</code> for each special chapter. For my case the ones I have for the front matter are: Front/Title page (a customised page), Abstract, Acknowledgements, <a href="#glosspreamble">Abbreviations</a>, Tables pages (Table of Contents, List of Figures, and List of Tables). For the back matter the files are: Appendices and References. I separated them from the other chapters since they special chapters and the way they were set were different from the rest of the regular chapters.</li>
  <li><code>Chapters/</code> &ndash; This folder contains 6 <code>.tex</code> files: <code>ch01.tex</code> to <code>ch06.tex</code></li>
  <li><code>Sections/</code> &ndash; This folder contains several <code>.tex</code> files, whose naming convention starts with the chapter the section is associated with e.g. <code>ch01_intro.tex</code> refers to Chapter 1 Introduction</li>
  <li><code>figuras/</code> &ndash; Contains <code>.tex</code> files for the figures in the thesis. Each file is created for each figure and called when writing using <code>\input{figuras/*figurefilename}</code>. These figures are the ones that use external images (i.e., images not generated through <code>LaTeX</code>)</li>
  <li><code>filesdat/</code> &ndash; Where all <code>.dat</code> data files are stored (for graphs, illustrations, etc.)</li>
  <li><code>fonts/</code> &ndash; Where I store all the fonts that I need in the thesis. Although they are my system fonts, I decided to store them here especially so that I need not use some hefty directory changes when calling the fonts I need</li>
  <li><code>imagen/</code> &ndash; Where the external images are stored (i.e., <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, etc. images); this folder is specified in the preamble as the path where all image files are stored</li>
  <li><code>mesas/</code> &ndash; Contains all the codes for the tables. Individual tables are individual <code>.tex</code> files so that in the section where I need the table I just use <code>\input{mesas/*tablefilename}</code></li>
  <li><code>tikzfiguras/</code> &ndash; This is where I store the files for figures generated using <code>TikZ/PGF</code>. Each file is then called within the thesis using <code>\input{tikzfiguras/*tikzfigurefilename}</code></li>
</ol>
<h1>Main TeX file</h1>
<p>This is how <code>THESIS.tex</code> looks like:</p>

<h3>Top of preamble</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-latex">
   \documentclass[a4paper,11pt]{report}
   \renewcommand*{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
   \usepackage[hoffset=0.5truein,vscale=0.8,footskip=1.8truecm]{geometry}
   \usepackage[english]{babel}</pre>

<h3 id="glosspreamble">Glossary</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-latex">
   \usepackage[nonumberlist,nopostdot,style=super]{glossaries}
   \usepackage{acronym}
   \usepackage{glossary-mcols}
   %firstchar uppercase, text lowercase
   <span class="highlighted">\let\firstchar\lowercase
   \let\oldprintglossary\printglossary
   \def\printglossary{\let\firstchar\uppercase\oldprintglossary}</span>

   \makeglossaries

   \renewcommand{\glsnamefont}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
   \setlength{\glsdescwidth}{0.8\textwidth}</pre>
<p>The <code>firstchar</code> code is from was from <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/79907/howto-achieve-capitalized-description-in-glossary-table" title="firstchar on TeX.SE" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> on <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/" title="TeX on SE" target="_blank">TeX.SE</a>. What this code does is that it renders the first letter of the definition uppercase on the Abbreviations page, and when used in the main text, the first letter is rendered in lowercase. Without this code, the whole thing becomes a wee bit awkward, with random words which are not meant to be in uppercase rendered as such.</p> 

<h3 id="glosspage">At the glossary page:</h3>
<p>This piece of code is inserted in the file <code>agloss.tex</code>. Since the chapter is not part of the usual numbered chapters, it is necessary to add the second line of the code so that the chapter is added to the Table of Contents page.  On line 10, <code>\glossyname</code> is a macro created so that the chapter is named as <strong>Abbreviations</strong> instead of <strong>Glossary</strong>. The <code>\textbf{Abbreviations}</code> part is a sort of hacky way of adding the title of the chapter in the Table of Contents, without it, the chapter title is added in the Table of Contents, but not in boldface.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-latex">
   \newpage
   <span class="highlighted">\cleardoublepage\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\textbf{Abbreviations}}</span>
   <span id="line3">\Charter</span>
   %example glossary entries
     \newacronym{CFCs}{CFCs}{\firstchar{C}hloroflurocarbons}
     \newacronym{GHGs}{GHGs}{\firstchar{G}reenhouse gases}
     \newacronym{IPCC}{IPCC}{Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}
   \begin{spacing}{1}
   \glsaddall
   <span class="highlighted">\printglossary[title={\glossyname}]</span>
   \end{spacing}
   \newpage</pre>
<p>As an example, here is what the entries in the Abbreviations page looks like:</p>
<div class="trim"><a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/a-mar/shiz/master/ths/demoabbrev.pdf" title="click for the full pdf page" target="_blank"><img class="fig" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/a-mar/shiz/master/ths/abbrv.PNG" alt="Abbreviations page"></a></div>
<p>Within the text, this is what the <code>firstchar</code> does:</p>
<div class="trim"><img class="fig" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/a-mar/shiz/master/ths/ghg.PNG" alt="GHGs"></div>
<div class="trim"><img class="fig" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/a-mar/shiz/master/ths/cfc.PNG" alt="CFCs"></div>
<p>Without <code>firstchar</code> since it is an organisation name:</p>
<div class="trim"><img class="fig" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/a-mar/shiz/master/ths/ipcc.PNG" alt="IPCC"></div>
<p class="sidenote">Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The macro <code>\glossyname</code> was created since what I have in my thesis were abbreviations and not definitions&mdash;which if it were the latter, then <strong>Glossary</strong> would have been more appropriate, and <code>\printglossary</code> would have sufficed.</li>
<li>The macro <code>\Charter</code> on <a href="#line3">line 3</a> of the code is a font macro, which is another hacky way of mine to render the body text as serif (Charter) while leaving the rest in sans-serif (Fira Sans).</li>
</ul>
</div>
